# AWS Static Website-Projects
This repostitory contains four AWS static website projects. [S3](https://github.com/KimAdrian1/AWS-Static-Website-Projects/tree/76a90ab58c49c1dd560e1ebc05f5b1e3e7599dd2/S3) is part one of the projects and demonstrates the process of hosting a static websites using AWS simple storage solution as the host. Part 2 of the projects: [S3 and CloudFront](https://github.com/KimAdrian1/AWS-Static-Website-Projects/tree/1d4188abde7409249b806436a42770d8caae895a/S3%20and%20CloudFront), goes further to include a content delivery network into the equation. The project demonstrates my ability to use the AWS CLI as well as the IAC tools: CloudFormation and Terraform, to conform with DevOps best practices. Part three: CI CD Pipeline adds a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline into the mix. CodePipeline and Github are used to facilitate the continuous deployment of code changes to the website files. Part four: Amplify is the final project demonstrating how an AWS fully managed service can replace the functions of all the 3 previous parts.
