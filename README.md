# AWS Static Website-Projects
This repostitory contains four AWS static website projects. S3 is part one of the projects and demonstrates the process of hosting a static websites using AWS Simple storage solution as the host. Part 2 of the projects: S3 and CloudFront, goes further to include a content delivery network into the equation. The project demonstrates my ability to use the AWS CLI as well as IAC tools: CloudFormation and Terraform, to conform with best DevOps practices. Part three: CI CD Pipeline adds a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline into the mix. CodePipeline and Github are used to facilitate the continuous deployment of code changes to the website files. Part four: Amplify is the final project demonstrating how an AWS fully managed service can replace the functions of all the 3 previous parts.
